## SSH

Daytona provides an option to specify whether users can connect to Workspaces via SSH. This option relies on IDEs that support SSH connections.

Click the toggle button to enable or disable connecting to Workspace via SSH. Refer to the [Workspace SSH connection](/usage/workspaces#workspace-ssh-connection) section for more information.

## Workspace Samples

Daytona provides an option to set Workspace Samples to streamline the process of setting up new Workspaces. You can create Samples with predefined configurations and settings, making it easier to create consistent Workspaces for your team.

Enter the URL of the endpoint which returns the Workspace Samples info.

Example of a Workspaces Samples endpoint provided by Daytona:

```shell
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daytonaio-templates/index/main/templates.json
```

The input Samples will show up as suggested repositories when creating a new Workspace.

## Workspace Retention Period

Daytona provides an option to set a retention period for Workspaces. This feature automatically deletes Workspaces that have been inactive for a specified period, helping you manage Workspace resources effectively.

Example of a retention period of 1 hour:

```shell
1h
```

Example of a retention period of 14 days:

```shell
14d
```

## Workspace Sharing Policy

Daytona provides an option to set a Workspace sharing policy. You can select the highest sharing scope users can choose for their Workspaces.

- `Everyone`

  Allows users to share their Workspaces with everyone.

- `Team`

  Allows users to share their Workspaces with their team members.

- `Private`

  Allows users to share their Workspaces with themselves only.

## SSH Access Token

Daytona provides an option to specify whether users can connect to Workspaces using an SSH access token.

Click the toggle button to enable or disable the use of the SSH access token. Refer to the [Workspace SSH connection](/usage/workspaces#workspace-ssh-connection) section for more information.

## Telemetry

Daytona provides an option to enable or disable telemetry to collect usage data. Telemetry helps improve Daytona by identifying the most valuable features, prioritizing use cases, and addressing common issues.

Click the toggle button to enable or disable telemetry.
