Samples are templates with predefined development configurations, environments, and dependencies used to create Workspaces.

Samples are defined by a **`devcontainer.json`** file that specifies the development environment used to create a Workspace.

## Samples Index

Samples require a Sample Index (`index.json`) file that serves as a registry of available Samples to be used for creating Workspaces. 

1. Create an **`index.json`** file representing the Samples Index.

2. Define an array of JSON objects representing the Samples.

    Each JSON object in the array represents a Sample:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "My Custom Sample",
    "gitUrl": "https://github.com/username/sample"
  }
]
```

- **`name`**

    Name of the Sample.

- **`gitUrl`**
    
    Link to the publicly available Git repository containing the Sample.

2. Host the **`index.json`** file publicly on a Git repository or another platform.

3. Enter the raw URL of the **`index.json`** file in the **`Workspace samples`** field. 

Example of a Samples Index raw URL:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/samples/main/index.json
```

4. Click **`Save`** to apply the changes.

The Samples Index provided will be used to display the available Samples while [creating Workspaces](/usage/workspaces#create-a-workspace).

The Sample will be cloned and used to create the Workspace. The repository will serve as the core content of your Sample and will be used to create your Workspace.

## Daytona Samples Index

[Daytona Samples Index](https://github.com/daytonaio/samples-index/blob/main/index.json) provides a collection of default Samples that can be used to create Workspaces with predefined development configurations, environments, and dependencies. 

1. Copy the raw URL of the default Samples Index:

```shell
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daytonaio/samples-index/main/index.json
```

2. Enter the raw URL of the default Samples Index in the **`Workspace samples`** field.

3. Click **`Save`** to apply the changes.

Daytona Samples Index will be used to display the available Samples when creating a Workspace. Proceed to use [Daytona Samples](#daytona-samples) to create Workspaces.

## Custom Samples

Daytona provides an option to use custom Samples to create a Workspace with predefined development configurations, environments, and dependencies.

1. Create a Git repository representing the custom Sample.

2. Define the custom Sample development configurations, environments, and dependencies.

3. Create a **`devcontainer.json`** file that defines the development environment.

- Use the [development container standard](https://containers.dev/) to define your development environment. Development containers vary based on the programming language, configurations, and tools used within the Sample.

Example of a **`devcontainer.json`** file for development environment using Go programming language:

```json
{
    "name": "Go",
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/go:1-1.21-bookworm",
    "customizations": {
        "vscode": {
            "extensions": [
                "golang.Go"
            ]
        }
    },
    "postCreateCommand": "go test -v"
}
```

4. Host the Samples publicly on a Git repository or another platform.

5. Update the [Samples Index](#samples-index) with the properties of the custom Sample.

You can now use the custom Samples to [create Workspaces](/usage/workspaces#create-a-workspace). Selecting a custom Sample will clone the repository and use it to create the Workspace. The repository will serve as the core content of the Sample and will be used to create your Workspace.

[View examples](https://github.com/orgs/daytonaio/repositories?q=sample) of custom Samples repositories provided by Daytona.

## Daytona Samples

Daytona provides a collection of Samples that can be used to create a Workspace with predefined development configurations, environments, and dependencies.

Daytona Samples will be available while [creating Workspaces](/usage/workspaces#create-a-workspace). The Sample will be cloned and used to create the Workspace. The Daytona repository with the Sample will serve as the core content of your Sample and will be used to create your Workspace.
