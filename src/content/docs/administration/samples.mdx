Samples can be used to create a Workspace with specific predefined configurations. You can create your own samples or use default samples provided by Daytona.

## Daytona Samples

## Custom Samples

Daytona provides an option to create custom samples that can be used to create a Workspace with specific predefined configurations. Custom samples can be created and hosted on a Git Provider or another platform.

To create a custom sample, create a JSON file that contains an array of objects. Each object represents a sample that can be used to create a Workspace.

1. Create a JSON file with an array of objects representing the samples.

Each object should include the following properties:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "My Custom Sample",
        "description": "This is a description of my custom sample.",
        "gitUrl": "https://github.com/username/sample",
        "imageUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/assets/image.png",
        "rawReadmeUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/sample/blob/main/README.md"
    }
]
```

- **`name`**

    Required.

    The name of the sample. This property will be used to identify the sample in the Workspace creation process.

- **`description`**
  
    Required.
    
    The description of the sample. This property will not be displayed.

- **`gitUrl`**
  
    Required.
    
    The link to the Git repository where the sample is hosted. This property will be used to clone the repository when creating a Workspace.

- **`imageUrl`**
    
    Required.

    The URL to an image representing the sample. Supported values are *JPG*, *JPEG*, *SVG* and *PNG* formats.

- **`rawReadmeUrl`**
      
    Required.

    A direct link to the raw README file in the Git repository. It provides additional information or documentation related to the sample.


2. In **`Settings`**, enter the custom samples raw URL in the **`Workspace samples`** field.

```sh
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/samples/main/index.json
```

2. Click **`Save`** to apply the changes.

The custom samples will be available when creating a Workspace. The sample will be cloned and used to create the Workspace. This repository will serve as the core content of your template and will be used to build your Workspace.

:::note

- The template must be hosted publicly, on a Git Provider or another platform.
- An array of objects must be accessible as raw content.
- Each object needs to include the required properties.
- **`gitUrl`** field must be a public repository.
