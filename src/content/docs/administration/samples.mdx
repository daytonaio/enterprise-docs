Samples can be used to create a Workspace with predefined configurations, environments, and dependencies. 

Daytona provides an option to use [default samples](#daytona-samples) or [create samples](#custom-samples) that can be used to create a Workspace.

## Daytona Samples

Daytona provides [default samples](https://github.com/daytonaio/samples-index/blob/main/index.json) you can use to create a Workspace with various configurations, environments, and dependencies.

1. Enter the default samples raw URL in the **`Workspace samples`** field.

```sh
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daytonaio/samples-index/main/index.json
```

2. Click **`Save`** to apply the changes.

The default samples will be available when [creating a Workspace](/docs/usage/workspaces). The sample will be cloned and used to create the Workspace.

## Create Samples

Daytona provides an option to create custom samples that can be used to create a Workspace. Custom samples can be created and hosted on a Git Provider or another platform.

1. Create a sample to define the development environment, dependencies, packages, and libraries that should be installed in the Workspace during creation.

- Samples can include files or references to container images that define the development environment in which the Workspace will run. 

- Samples can define the dependencies, packages and libraries that should be installed in the Workspace during creation.

- Samples can provide configuration files that define project-specific settings or environmental variables required by the application.

View an example of a sample structure in the Daytona [sample-go](https://github.com/daytonaio/sample-go/tree/main) repository.

2. Create a JSON file with an array of objects representing the samples.

Each object represents a sample that can be used to create a Workspace. Each object must include the following properties:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "My Custom Sample",
    "description": "This is a description of my custom sample.",
    "gitUrl": "https://github.com/username/sample",
    "imageUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/image.png",
    "rawReadmeUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/sample/blob/main/README.md"
 }
]
```

- **`name`**

    Required.

    The name of the sample. This property will be used to identify the sample in the Workspace creation process.

- **`description`**
  
    Required.
    
    The description of the sample. This property will not be displayed.

- **`gitUrl`**
  
    Required.
    
    The link to the Git repository where the sample is hosted. This property will be used to clone the repository when creating a Workspace.

- **`imageUrl`**
    
    Required.

    The URL to an image representing the sample. Supported values are *JPG*, *JPEG*, *SVG* and *PNG* formats.

- **`rawReadmeUrl`**
      
    Required.

    A direct link to the raw README file in the Git repository. It provides additional information or documentation related to the sample.

3. Host the custom samples JSON file publicly on a Git Provider or another platform.

Follow the guide below to [use samples](#use-samples) in Daytona.

:::note

- The samples must be hosted publicly, on a Git Provider or another platform.
- An array of objects must be accessible as raw content.
- Each object needs to include the required properties.
- **`gitUrl`** field must be a public repository.

## Use Samples

Daytona provides an option to use [default](#daytona-samples) or [custom](#custom-samples) samples when creating a Workspace.

1. Enter the default samples or custom samples raw URL in the **`Workspace samples`** field.

Example of a raw URL for samples:

```sh
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/samples/main/index.json
```

2. Click **`Save`** to apply the changes.

The custom samples will be available when creating a Workspace. The sample will be cloned and used to create the Workspace. The repository will serve as the core content of your sample and will be used to build your Workspace.
