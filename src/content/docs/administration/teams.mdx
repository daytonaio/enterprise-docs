Teams allow users to collaborate and share resources efficiently. Each team has an assigned owner and a quota, which dictates the resources available for that team.

## View Teams

Daytona provides the option to view all the teams you are part of or manage. Each team is listed with the following details:

- **Team**

    The name of the team.

- **Owner**

    The user who created the team and has administrative rights.

- **Quota**

    The resource limits and permissions assigned to the team.

## Edit Team Quotas

Daytona provides the option to edit the quota assigned to a team. This allows the team owner to adjust the resource limits and permissions. 

1. Click the pencil icon **`âœŽ`** next to the team's quota to edit it.

You will be presented with a list of quotas that can be revoked or applied.

2. **`Revoke`** or **`Apply`** the quotas as required.
