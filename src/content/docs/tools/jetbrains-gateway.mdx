Daytona's JetBrains Gateway plugin allows you to connect to your Daytona workspace from JetBrains Gateways; An application purpose-built for cloud-based development environments without needing to download the selected JetBrains IDE which drastically enhances your development experience. 

To use Daytona's extension, you need to meet several requirements. In this guide, we'll walk you through the essential components: prerequisite checks, installation, connection setup (with two connection options), effective usage, and a clean uninstallation process. By the end of this guide, you will be able to use Daytona's JetBrains extension with ease. 


## Prerequisites 

Before you can start using Daytona's JetBrains Gateway Plugin, the following prerequisites are required to use Daytona's JetBrains extension:

- **Daytona Installation**: If you haven't installed Daytona on your own infrastructure, please follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/daytonaio/installer) to install Daytona.

- **Daytona Dashboard URL**: To complete the setup, you'll need the URL of your Daytona dashboard, which you can obtain from [installation](https://github.com/daytonaio/installer). 

- **JetBrains Gateway**: You need to have a JetBrains Gateway installed on your local machine. If you haven't installed JetBrains Gateway, please navigate to the [JetBrains Gateway homepage](https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/gateway/), scroll down on the page, and find the `Download` button to install the JetBrains Gateway version that suits your local hardware condition.

:::tip
Although you don't have to install the IDE you intend to use, as JetBrains' Gateway will handle it for you, you still need to have an active JetBrains license to the respective IDE.
:::



## How to install

The installation process is split into two parts. The first is the package installation, and the second part on how you establish the connection between your [Daytona installation](#prerequisites) and JetBrains Gateway. You will have to install the Daytona Gateway Plugin Package.


1. **Daytona's JetBrains Plugin Installation**: Click on this link [Daytona Gateway Plugin Package](https://download.daytona.io/jetbrains/gateway/latest/jetbrains-gateway-daytona-plugin-latest.jar) to download the latest package (if the download didn't start automatically, navigate to [this link](https://download.daytona.io/) to find the latest JetBrains Gateway plugin version: Home page > JetBrains > gateway > latest). The download will start automatically. <u>Remember the location, or directory of where the package is downloaded to, as you will need it later.</u>



:::note
This package will help you connect with JetBrains Gateway. If you click on it directly, it won't respond. Because it will only work with JetBrains Gateway (within the application itself).
:::



2. **Select Managing Providers in JetBrains Gateway**: Open the JetBrains Gateway application, at the bottom left corner of the welcome screen, click on the settings button. At the dropdown menu after you click on the settings button, select `Managing Providers`.  

3. **Install Plugin from Disk**: At the pop-up window `Plugins`(after you click on `Managing Providers`), click on the settings button on the top next to `Installed`. At the dropdown menu, click on `Install Plugin from Disk` right below the option `Manage Plugin Certificates`.

4. **Select the Daytona Gateway Plugin Package**: After you click on `Install Plugin from Disk`, your default File Explorer will pop up. You will need to locate where the [Daytona JetBrains Gateway Plugin Package](https://download.daytona.io/jetbrains/gateway/latest/jetbrains-gateway-daytona-plugin-latest.jar) is to install it on to JetBrains Gateway Client. Find the Daytona Gateway Plugin Package you downloaded (in the pop-up file explorer) earlier to open it. JetBrains Gateway will install the package automatically.

5. **Finish installation**: JetBrains Gateway will navigate you back to the `Plugins` screen. You will see the Daytona Gateway Plugin Package is installed (under the search bar `/downloaded`). Click on the blue `OK` button at the bottom right to close the plugin window. 

_After you click on the `OK` button, JetBrains will bring you back to the `Welcome to JetBrains Gateway` screen. You are now ready to connect to your Daytona workspace._

### Establishing a connection 

Now you are on the welcome window of JetBrains Gateway where it shows `Welcome to JetBrains Gateway` on the top of the window. You will see several options to run IDE Remotely. `SSH Connection`, `JetBrains Space`, `Docker Dev Containers`, and `Daytona`. 

There are three options you can use to connect to your Daytona [workspaces](/usage/workspace) when you are connecting for the first time. This connection will keep your workspaces, profiles and teams in-sync with your Daytona installation. In this section, we will walk you through each one of them.

</TabItem> 
</Tabs>

_After these steps, your Daytona installation with JetBrains Gateway is established. you will be navigated to Daytona's configuration screen on JetBrains Gateway, which includes your team name, GitHub username, etc. We will talk about them in the next section._

## Features

Now that you have established the connection between your Daytona installation and JetBrains Gateway, you can navigate to Daytona's configuration screen by clicking on the `Connect` button under Daytona on the welcome screen. In this section, we will walk you through the features of Daytona's JetBrains Gateway Plugin, including how to create, manage, and use your [workspace](/usage/workspaces), how to manage team, profile information, and more.

### Creating workspaces

Each [workspace](/usage/workspaces) created on Daytona is isolated in its own environment, even if it is based on the same repository. In the following two sub-sections, we will talk about how to create and manage your workspaces with Daytona in JetBrains Gateway. Workspaces created within the JetBrains Gateway via the Daytona plugin are synced with your Daytona installation. 

{/*TODO: Second tier ordered list font colors are not correct, this spacing error will disappear if this comment is removed*/}

- **Create a workspace** <br/>
Within the Daytona configuration screen in JetBrains Gateway (the screen that shows up after you click on `Connect to Daytona` on the welcome screen), there are two ways to create a workspace:

- 1. **Create via repository URL**: In the input field `or enter a public repository URL`, you can paste in a repository you have access to, be it a public repository or private repository you own. Then click on `New Workspace` to create a workspace.

- 2. **Create via dropdown menu**: On the right side of the field `Repository:`, click on the dropdown menu and select a repository, then click on `New Workspace` to create a workspace. Note that <u>it may take a couple of seconds to create and start a workspace until it is loaded, appearing under `Recent Workspaces`</u>. If you click on it multiple times while the workspace is creating, or starting, you are <u>accidentally creating multiple workspace</u> with the same repository.


### Managing workspaces

- **Checking workspaces**: Workspaces that have been created on your Daytona dashboard will show up on the Daytona configuration screen under the section `Recent workspaces` with their status (whether it is started, created, or stopped). If a workspace has been started, a circle will be lighted up on the left side of the workspace, you can see the workspace with `started xxx time ago`. 

- **Pinning a workspace**: You can also pin the workspace (by clicking on the pin button) if you have a lot of workspaces being created, and you want to keep them visible on the configuration screen. 

- **Opening workspaces**: On the Daytona configuration screen, you can click on a workspace's name that has been created (the ones under `Recent workspace`) to open a workspace, or you can open it by clicking on `Open` (after clicking on the dots). On the next screen `Choose an IDE`, choose a JetBrains IDE you need to work on. It will take a couple of seconds to connect to the remote machine and local binary ready to open the workspace in your selected IDE. If you close the window that shows `Running` while it's getting ready, JetBrains Gateway will stop the remote connection. 

- **Working in a workspace**

- 1. **Linux terminal**: Once you are working on a workspace in an IDE and start a terminal session within the IDE, you can treat it like a Linux terminal (because it is one). You can install software, or use Docker within the terminal. 
- 2. **Debugging**: On the top right side of the IDE, you can click on the debug button (on the top right) to debug your code. The debug panel at the bottom will show you the debugging log, the same as how you'd do it locally. If any extension is suggested to install within the IDE, you can also install them on the workspace and they will be persisted.
- 3. **Live preview link**: If you are working on a web application (port forwarding is supported), you can run `npm run dev` (or other commands) to start the local development server. Once the server is up and running, you can either click on the URL that shows up in the terminal to see the application locally (you can only see live change if your application enabled hot module replacement([HMR](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/)), if not, you can only see changes after restarting the server).

{/*TODO: This feature isn't yet built, put this back after it is built*/}
{/*- 4. **Sharing live preview link**: On the [tool window](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/guided-tour-around-the-user-interface.html#tool-windows), you will see a message `Your application is running on port <port-number>` with a port number when the local development server is running. Click on the port number next to the <Icon icon="chevron-down-dark" class="icon-display"/> icon. From the dropdown menu, select `Forward Port and Open Browser`, you will see your default browser opened with a sharable link. Click on `Make public` to make sure the link is accessible to everyone on the internet. You can share this link for others to see live updates*/ }

- **Stopping workspaces**: To stop a workspace, you can click on the dots `...` button and then click on `Stop`. Once a workspace is stopped, you can always bring it back by clicking on the `Open` button on the dropdown menu(after you click on the dots `...` button on one of the workspaces). 


:::caution
- **Destroying a workspace**: This action is irreversible. Once you destroy it, you will lose all the installation and previous environment setup, unless you have them specified in `.devcontainer.json`. You can do so by clicking on the dots `...` button on the selected workspace then select `Destroy`.
:::

- **Granting access to organization access**: Organization members can always request that an owner approve access to organization resources for Daytona, and organization owners receive notification of pending requests. For further information, check [here](/installation/idps#). 


### Managing profiles

Different profiles are equivalent to different Daytona installations, which might associated with your organization, or be personal, identifiable by your Daytona URL. profile-related configuration is located next to `Profile:` on JetBrains Gateway's Daytona configuration screen. 

- **Checking profiles**: Next to the `Profiles:`, click on the dropdown menu and you will see all of your available profiles. Note that workspaces are correlated to your Daytona installation (aka profile), if you switch your profile you won't see the same workspaces on the previously selected profile. 

- **Adding a profile**:

- 1. Click on the `Add profile` button next to the `Edit` button. On the pop-up window, you will need to input `Name`(being displayed on Daytona's JetBrains Gateway configuration page, use a domain name for ease of recognition) and `Base Api URL`(your Daytona dashboard URL, no subdomain required. For example: if your Daytona dashboard URL is `https://daytona.com`, the input for this field would be `daytona.com`). 

- 2. After inputting the information, click on `New`. You will then be redirected to your Daytona dashboard's signin page to select an identity provider to sign in. Depending on whether you have a session that exists(that you are signed in) with your identity provider, you may be redirected to your identity provider(Github, Gitlab, BitBucket) to sign in. 

- 3. After signing in to your identity provider, you will be asked whether you'd like to grant access to JetBrains, click on `Yes` to continue. Once the profile (an installation) establishes a connection with JetBrains Gateway, you should be able to see your workspaces or create workspaces based on different identity providers associated with that profile. 

- **Editing a profile**: On the Daytona configuration screen (after you click on `Connect to Daytona` on JetBrains Gateway's welcome screen), you can click on the edit button next to profile dropdown menu to edit your profiles. Once you click on it, you will be able to see and edit the name, Base Api URL, Keycloak Realm, Keycloak URL and SSH Port on the pop-up window `Edit. After you finish editing your profile, you can click on `Store` to confirm editing, or cancel the current edit by clicking on `Cancel`. 

- **Delete a profile**: You can click on the edit button on the Daytona configuration screen and then select `Delete` to delete a profile. 


### Managing teams

At the moment, you can only manage team-related information on your Daytona dashboard. Note that your workspaces are correlated to your team. If you switch to another team (say Team B), you won't be seeing workspaces created on the previous team(say Team A).

- **Switching team**: You can see all the teams on the Daytona configuration screen on JetBrains Gateway. Next to the field `Teams:`, click on the dropdown menu to check what team exists with your account, or switch to another team.
