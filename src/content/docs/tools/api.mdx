Our API is a RESTful API based on the OpenAPI 3.0 specification. It is a
JSON API that uses standard HTTP response codes and verbs, and token-based  authentication.

Our API is currently in beta. We are actively working on it and will be
adding new endpoints and features regularly. If you have any questions or
feedback, please [contact us](mailto:servicedesk@daytona.io).
