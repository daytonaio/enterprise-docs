**Current API version: <ApiVersion/>**

The Daytona API is a REST-styled API based on the OpenAPI 3.0.1 specification  gives you full control over your Daytona deployment. It allows developers to interact with your own Daytona deployment, deploy new clusters, manage existing clusters, retrieve infromation about deployemnt and configurations, manage secrets and perform other operations using HTTP requests programmatically. 

The API uses standard HTTP response codes and verbs, and follows `OAuth2`  authentication protocols. Any programming languages or framework that can make HTTP requests can use the API to interact with your Daytona deployment.


## API Endpoint

Every Daytona deployment has its own API endpoint and documentations. 

Example as follow:

<dl>
<dt>Daytona dashboard URL</dt>
<dd>`https://daytona.domain.com` your deployment URL.</dd>
<dt>API Endpoint</dt>
<dd>`https://api.daytona.domain.com`</dd>
<dt>API Documentation</dt>
<dd>`https://api.daytona.domain.com/v3/docs`</dd>
</dl>

## API Basics

Our API is exposed as an HTTP/1 adn HTTP/2 service over SSL. All endpoints live under your specific endpoint and generally follow the REST architecture. 

### Server Specs 

#### HTTP and TLS 

The API supports HTTP version 1, 1.1, and 2, although HTTP/2 is preferred. 

TLS version 1.3 is supported with resumption. 

For more information on TLS support, paste your endpoint in [SSL Labs report](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html).

#### Content Type 

Al requests must be encoded as JSON with the `Content-Type: application/json` header. If not otherwise specified (some are `*/*`), responses from your Daytona API, including errors, are encoded as JSON as well. 



## Authentication
Daytona API is token based, follows the OAuth2 authentication protocol.

### Creating an Access Token 
Access Tokens can be created and managed from inside [TBC].

### Expiration 
Setting an expiration date on an Access Token is **highly recommended** and is considered one of the standard security practices that helps keep your information secure. 

You can select from a range of expiration dates, [TBC]. You can view the expiration date of an Access Token by clicking on the token in the [TBC] page.

### Revoking an Access Token
You can revoke an Access Token at any time from the [TBC] page. Once revoked, the token is no longer valid and cannot be used to make API calls.

### Regenerating an Access Token

You can regenerate an Access Token at any time from the [TBC] page. Once regenerated, the old token is no longer valid and cannot be used to make API calls.

### Using an Access Token

### Failed Authentication 
If authentication is unsuccessful for a request, the **`401`** or **`403`** response code is returned.

{/*No rate limits and error handling in API/swagger?*/}

## Versioning
All endpoints and examples are designated with a specific version. Versions do not vary per endpoint and are global [TBC]. 

To ensure the security and correctness of your application, make sure to **only read the keys from the response** that your application expects. Don't proxy entire responses to third-parties without validation. 

{/*Any changelog to notify user if API endpoint/responses changes?*/}

Endpoint versions follow the base URL and come before the endpoint. For example:

```json 
https://api.daytona.domain.com/v3/clusters
```
