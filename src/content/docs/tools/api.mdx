**Current API version: <ApiVersion/>**

The Daytona API is a REST-styled API based on the OpenAPI 3.0.1 specification  gives you full control over your Daytona deployment. It allows developers to interact with your own Daytona deployment, deploy new clusters, manage existing clusters, retrieve infromation about deployemnt and configurations, manage secrets and perform other operations via Swagger documentation. 

The API uses standard HTTP response codes and verbs, and follows `OAuth2`  authentication protocols. 

<hr/>

## API Endpoint

Every Daytona deployment has its own API endpoint and documentations. 

Example as follow:

<dl>
<dt>Daytona dashboard URL</dt>
<dd>`https://daytona.domain.com` your deployment URL.</dd>
<dt>API Documentation</dt>
<dd>`https://api.daytona.domain.com/v3/docs`. An auto-generated Swagger documentation to use API in a browser. </dd>
</dl>

## API Basics

Our API is exposed as an HTTP/1 adn HTTP/2 service over SSL. All endpoints live under your specific endpoint and generally follow the REST architecture. 

### Server Specs 

#### HTTP and TLS 

The API supports HTTP version 1, 1.1, and 2, although HTTP/2 is preferred. 

TLS version 1.3 is supported with resumption. 

For more information on TLS support, paste your endpoint in [SSL Labs report](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html).

#### Content Type 

Al requests must be encoded as JSON with the `Content-Type: application/json` header. If not otherwise specified (some are `*/*`), responses from your Daytona API, including errors, are encoded as JSON as well. As these settings are injected in Swagger documentation automatically, no further configuration are needed. 

<hr/>

## Authentication
Daytona's API key can be automatically injected into Swagger documentation after authentication. Unless specify differently, most of the Daytona API endpoints are token based, follows the OAuth2 authentication protocol (`client_secret`). We will walk through how you can create and authenticate via [`client_secret`](#finding-client-secret) to use our API endpoints in Swagger documentation.

:::note 
When `workspaceToken` is required, it overwrites the `client_secret` and you will only need `workspaceToken` to authenticate. 
:::

1. Authorize on the Swagger documentation
- In the browser, open `https://api.daytona.domain.com/v3/docs` to access Swagger documentation.
- On the top right corner, **click `Authorize`** to open the authorization dialog. 

2. Sign in on Dashboard to authenticate 
- After you click on `Authorize`, a dialog will open. 
- **Under the `oauth2` section, click on `Authorize`**. A new browser tab will open and redirect you to the Daytona dashboard sign in page. 
- Sign in on the new pop-up page. Your API endpoints will be authenticated and `client_secret` will be automatically injected in the Swagger documentation. 

3. Authenticate Daytona API Documentation
- After you are authenticated, you can click on `Close` to close the dialog. 
- Try to perform an API request, you will see the `client_secret` is automatically injected in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer` token.


### Expiration 
Daytona does not offer static API keys. The `client_secret` will **expire within 5 minutes** and you won't be able to set an expiration time.

:::note
After expiration, click `Authorize` again on Swagger documentation to re-authenticate.
:::

More example about how to use `client_secret` and `workspaceToken` in the following sections [example api request](#api-request-example).


### Failed Authentication 
If authentication is unsuccessful for a request, do a hard refresh in the browser by pressing <Keyboard shortcuts={["Shift ⇧", "Command ⌘", "R"]}/> in the browser to perform a hard refresh. Then go through the authorization process again. If the issue persists, you can contact us via [email](mailto:servicedesk@daytona.io) or [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/daytonacommunity/shared_invite/zt-273yohksh-Q5YSB5V7tnQzX2RoTARr7Q).

{/*No rate limits and error handling in API/swagger?*/}

<hr/>

## Versioning
All endpoints and examples are designated with a specific version. Versions do not vary per endpoint and are global [TBC]. 

To ensure the security and correctness of your application, make sure to **only read the keys from the response** that your application expects. Don't proxy entire responses to third-parties without validation. 

{/*Any changelog to notify user if API endpoint/responses changes?*/}

Endpoint versions follow the base URL and come before the endpoint. For example:

```json 
https://api.daytona.domain.com/v3/clusters
```

| `number` | A whole number without decimal. | `1` |
| `object` | A data structure with a list of values assigned to a unique key. | `{ "key": "value" }` |
| `array` | A list of values. | `[ "value1", "value2" ]` |
| `boolean` | A value that is either `true` or `false`. | `true` |
| `enum` | A value that is one of a predefined set of values. | [ 'value1', 'value2'] |
