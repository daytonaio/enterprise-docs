To enable Identity Providers (IDPs) in your Daytona installation, we integrate [Keycloak](https://www.Keycloak.org/), an open-source identity and access management solution. Keycloak facilitates the addition of multiple IDPs, allowing users to authenticate to the Daytona dashboard through various identity providers. 

This setup enables the creation of Workspaces from different [Git Providers](/configuration/git-providers), and allows for the management of access scopes, permissions, sessions, and events. Additionally, Daytona provides tools to monitor and manage user activities within your organization.

This guide provides instructions on how to add, manage, configure, and disable Identity Providers (IDPs) using Keycloak.

 :::note
Keycloak comes as prepackaged with Daytona. You can access it via `https://id.domain`. 

For example, if you deployed Daytona at `https://daytona.example.com`, you can access Keycloak via `https://id.daytona.example.com`.
 :::


## Prerequisites 

To configure and manage identity providers for your Daytona installation, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Daytona Installation**

    [Download and install Daytona](https://github.com/daytonaio/installer) on your infrastructure. Upon completion, you will receive a URL to access your Daytona dashboard. During the Daytona installation, credentials for accessing Keycloak via the Administration Console (username or email and password) will be provided.

2. **Keycloak URL**

    Access the Keycloak URL provided during the Daytona installation.

3. **Registered Account with a Supported IDP:**

    Ensure you have a registered account with one of the supported identity providers. Supported IDPs include [Github](https://github.com/), [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/), [Github Enterprise Server](https://github.com/enterprise), [Gitlab On-Premise](https://about.gitlab.com/install/), [Bitbucket server](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/enterprise), Google, Microsoft and many more.


:::tip
It could be useful in this guide to open two browser tabs at the same time. One for identity providers like [Github](https://github.com) and one for KeyCloak.

## Github

In this section, we will guide you through the process of configuring GitHub as an identity provider for your Daytona installation. This guide applies only if GitHub was not configured as an identity provider during the initial Daytona installation.

### Configure Github in Keycloak

{/*TODO: any way we can get their IP address and resolve their domain name directly in the doc?*/}

<br />

1. **Log into Keycloak**

- Open `https://id.domain.com` and select **`Administration Console`** on the front page.
- Sign in using the credentials provided during the installation process (assuming you have met all the [prerequisites](#prerequisites)).

2. **Default Realm**
- After you sign in, make sure you are on the **`default`** realm.
- If you are not on the default realm (*the home page shows scattered information with Server information and the title master realm*), select **`default`** under the dropdown menu on the top left side of the home page.

3. **Configure GitHub as an Identity Provider**
- Under the default realm, click on **`Identity Providers`** under the *Configure* section on the left sidebar.
- Then click on **`github`**. On the next page, copy the **`Redirect URI`** and note it down, as we will need it later. *Don't close this tab*.

4. **Go to Developer Settings**
- Open [Github](https://github.com) in your browser, on the top right side of this page, click on your profile picture. Under the dropdown window, select **`Settings`** (at the bottom). Select **`Developer setting`s** on the left sidebar.

5. **Create OAuth Apps**
- Select the **`OAuth Apps`** on the left sidebar. Then click on **`New OAuth App`** on the top right side.

6. **Required Inputs for GitHub OAuth**

- For the application name, you can name it as easily recognizable for yourself and distinguish it from your other applications (recommend using deployed domain).
- The **`Homepage URL`** would be the URL to your Daytona dashboard.
- The **`Authorization callback URL`** is the URL you have copied from step 2, `Redirect URI`. You don't need to toggle `Enable Device Flow` here. Then click on **`Register application`**.

7. **Copy Client ID and Secrets**
- Under your application, click on the **`Generate a new client secret`** in the *Client secrets* section.
- Copy the **`credentials under Client ID`** and paste it into your Keycloak *Provider details* page in the Client ID section.
- Go back to the Github OAuth Application page, copy the **`credentials under the Client secrets`** section, and then paste it into *Client Secret* on your Keycloak *Provider details* page.

8. **Advance Settings on Keycloak**
- On Keycloak's Provider details page, copy and paste the following text into the field **`Scopes`** under the **`Advanced settings`**:

```shell
    read:user user:email repo
```
> - These three scopes will allow users to sign in via email, read GitHub users' information, and access signed-in users' repositories to gain read, write, and admin rights. 
> - Toggle the fields `Store tokens` and `Trust Email` to turn them on. You can compare your information to the [table below](#github-and-keycloak-configuration-details) to make sure the details are correctly configured. 
> - If you want to type in scopes by yourself, remember to use <Keyboard shortcuts="Space ␣" /> to separate different scopes and not comma <Keyboard shortcuts="," />.

9. **Save and Enable GitHub**
- After inputting all the information, click on **`Save`** at the bottom of Keycloak's Provider details page, then toggle *Disabled* on the top right side of the page to change it to **`Enabled`**.

### Confirm Github is Working

- To confirm Github is working properly with Daytona, refer to the [Git Provider](/configuration/git-providers#github) section to see if you can create a Workspace based on the repository in Github.


-  If you open your Daytona dashboard URL, you should see the button **`Github`** on the sign-in page. If not, scan through the table above and confirm if all the input information is correct.

## GitLab 

If you choose another identity provider during the installation stage, you can still configure GitLab as an add-on identity provider. In this section, we will explain how you can do so. You will need to have a GitLab account. 

### Configure GitLab in Keycloak

1. **Log into GitLab**

- [Sign into Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in). After signing in, click on your profile picture on the top of the left sidebar. Under the dropdown menu, select **`Preferences`**.

2. **Create OAuth Application**

- Click on **`Applications`** on the left sidebar. Then, click on **`Add new application`**.

3. **Default realm**

- Log into your Keycloak's Administration with credentials you obtained from the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section. After you sign in, make sure you are on the **`default realm`**.

- You should see the homepage show *Welcome to default* at the center of the screen. If not (the homepage shows scattered information with *Server info* with the title *master realm*), select **`default`** under the dropdown menu on the top left side of the homepage.

4. **Configure GitLab as Identity Provider**

- Click on **`Identity Providers`** under the *Configure* section on the left sidebar.
- Click on **`gitlab`**.
- On the next page copy the **`Redirect URI`**. *Don't close this tab*.

5. **GitLab application configuration**

- Go back to GitLab (you should be on the page `Add new application`).
- The **`Name`** of your application should be recognizable to yourself.
- The field **`Redirect URI`** is the `Redirect URI` you have copied from the last step.
- Toggle the **`Confidential`** under the `Redirect URI` field.
- Under the scope, toggle `api`, `read_api`, `read_user`, `read_repository`, `openid`, `write_repository`, `profile`, and `email`. Then click on **`Save application`**. If you are unsure about the settings under `Scope` in GitLab, you can refer to the [table below](#gitlab-and-keycloak-configuration-details) to make sure the settings are correct.

6. **Copy Application ID and Secret**

- Copy the **`Application ID`** and paste it into your Keycloak's Provider details page in the *Client ID* field
- Copy the **`Secret`** field and paste it into the *Client Secret* field.
- Click on **`Continue`** on GitLab's application page.

7. **Configure Keycloak**

- Navigate back to Keycloak's Provider details page for GitLab (at this stage you have filled in **`Client ID`** and **`Client Secret`**), copy the following value into the **`Scopes`** field under the *Advanced settings* section:

```shell
    profile email read_user write_repository read_repository openid api read_api
```
> - These scopes will allow your Daytona installation to access the signed-in user's profile, email, and respective repository(allow Daytona to create [Workspace](/usage/workspaces)), use OpenID to authenticate users during sign-in, read and access [GitLab's API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/api_resources.html) to work with Workspaces. 
> - Toggle the fields `Store tokens` and `Trust Email` to turn them on. You can compare your information to the [table below](#gitlab-and-keycloak-configuration-details) to make sure the details are correctly configured.
> - If you want to type in scopes by yourself, remember to use <Keyboard shortcuts="Space ␣" /> to separate different scopes instead of a comma <Keyboard shortcuts="," />.

8. **Enable GitLab**

- After finishing the above steps, on Keycloak, click **`Save`** at the bottom of the page (on Keycloak), and then enable the identity provider (toggle the *Disabled* switch on the top right side of the page to **`Enabled`**).

### Confirm GitLab is Working

You can refer to the [Git Provider](/configuration/git-providers#gitlab) section to see if you can create a Workspace based on the repository in GitLab to confirm GitLab is working properly with Daytona.

## Bitbucket

In this section, we will guide you through how to configure Bitbucket as your add-on identity provider if you haven't done so during the installation process. You will need a registered account and a Workspace connected to that account on Bitbucket. 

### Configure Bitbucket in Keycloak

1. **Create OAuth Consumer on Bitbucket**

- You can sign into Bitbucket with [this link](https://id.atlassian.com/login?application=bitbucket&continue=https://bitbucket.org/account/signin/?next%3D%252F%26redirectCount%3D1). After you sign in, click on the settings button on the top right, then in the dropdown menu select **Workspace settings**.
- Scroll down and find *APPS AND FEATURES* section in the left sidebar. Under this section, click on **`OAuth consumers`** and then click on **`Add consumer`** on this page.

2. **Default Realm in Keycloak**

- Open `https://id.domain.com` and click on **`Administration Console`** on the front page, then sign in with the credentials you obtained from your installation.
- After you sign in, make sure you are on the **`default realm`**.
- You should see the homepage show *Welcome to default* at the center of the screen. If not (the home page shows scattered information with *Server info* with the title *master realm*), you can select **`default`** under the dropdown menu on the top left side of the home page.

3. **Configure Bitbucket as an Identity Provider**

- Click on **`Identity Providers`** under the *Configure* section on the left sidebar
- Click on **`bitbucket`**.
- Copy the **`Redirect URI`** and note it down, as we will need it later. *Don't close this tab*.

4. **Configure OAuth consumer**

- Navigate back to Bitbucket, on the *Add OAuth consumer* page, give your application a distinguishable name in the **`Name`** field (required, example: `daytona-domain-name`)
- Paste the **`Redirect URI`** from the previous step into the **`Callback URL`** field.
- The **`URL`** field will be your Daytona dashboard URL.
- You can leave the `Privacy policy URL` and `End user license agreement URL` empty. Make sure **not to toggle `This is a private consumer`**. Your configuration will fail if you enable this.

5. **Permissions Scopes in Bitbucket**

- Under the *Permissions* section on the same page, tick the permission scope:
> - Account: `Email`, `Read`
> - Workspace membership: `Read`, `Write`
> - Projects: `Read`, `Write`, `Admin`
> - Repositories: `Read`, `Write`, `Admin`
> - Pull requests: `Read`
- Click **`Save`** at the bottom.
- If you are unsure about the settings under `Permissions` in Bitbucket, you can refer to the [table below](#bitbucket-and-keycloak-configuration-details) to make sure the settings are correct.

6. **Copy Key and Secret**

- After clicking on **`Save`**, you will be sent back to the *OAuth consumers* page in Bitbucket. Click on the application name you just created on Bitbucket's Workspace settings/OAuth consumers page.
- Copy the value after **`Key`** on Bitbucket and paste it into Keycloak's *Client ID* field.
- Copy the value after **`Secret`** on Bitbucket and paste it into Keycloak's *Client Secret* field.

7. **Configure Keycloak**
- Under the *Advance settings* section, copy and paste the following value into the field **`Scope`**:

```shell 
email account repository:write project
```
> - These permission scopes will allow us to access authenticated users' email, account details, and project-related information and gain write access to repositories to create a Workspace. 

8. Enable Bitbucket
- After finishing the above steps, on Keycloak, click **`Save`** at the bottom, and then **`Enabled`** the identity provider (toggle the *Disabled* switch on the top right side on the page).

### Confirm Bitbucket is Working

After you finish all the configuration, you can refer to the [BitBucket section](/configuration/git-providers#bitbucket) in Git Providers guide and visit your Daytona dashboard to confirm the configuration is correct and working properly.

4. **Configure OAuth Application on Github Enterprise**

- Go back to Github Enterprise, on the *Register a new OAuth application* page, fill in the following information:
- The **`Application name`** would be something recognizable to yourself. Recommend using your domain name.
- The **`Homepage URL`** would be your Daytona dashboard URL.
- The **`Authorization callback URL`** is the *Redirect URI* you have copied from the previous step.
- You don't need to toggle `Enable Device Flow` here. Then click on *`*Register application`**.

5. **Copy Client ID and Secrets**

- Under your application, click on the **`Generate a new client secret`** in the *Client secrets* section.
- Copy the **`credentials under Client ID`** and paste it into your Keycloak *Provider details* page in the *Client ID* section.
- Go back to the Github Enterprise OAuth Application page, copy the **`credentials under the Client secrets`** section, and then paste it into *Client Secret* on your Keycloak.
- **! important**: At the **`Base URL`** input field in Keycloak, paste your Github Enterprise URL (the dashboard URL where it is deployed, no trailing slash at the end).

:::caution
You need to input your **`Base URL`** without the last trailing slash. For example, if your Github Enterprise URL is `https://github-enterprise.example.com`, you will need to input `https://github-enterprise.example.com` into the `Base URL` field.<br/>
If you input `https://github-enterprise.example.com/`, this step will fail.
:::

6. **Configure Scopes in Keycloak**
- Under the *Advance settings* section, copy and paste the following value into the field **`Scope`**:

```shell
read:user user:email repo
```

> - These permission scopes will allow us to access authenticated users' email, account details, and access signed-in users' repositories to gain read, write, and admin rights.
> - Toggle the fields **`Store tokens`** and **`Trust Email`** to turn them on. You can compare your information to the [table below](#github-enterprise-and-keycloak-configuration-details) to make sure the details are correctly configured.
> - If you want to type in scopes by yourself, remember to use `Space ␣` to separate different scopes instead of a comma `,`.

7. **Enable Github Enterprise**

- After finishing the above steps, on Keycloak, click **`Save`** at the bottom of the page (on Keycloak), and then enable the identity provider (toggle the *Disabled* switch on the top right side on the page).

### Confirm Github Enterprise is Working

- To confirm Github Enterprise is working properly with Daytona, refer to the [Git Provider](/configuration/git-providers#github-enterprise) section to see if you can create a Workspace based on the repository in Github Enterprise.

## Bitbucket Server

If you or your organization deployed BitBucket Server as your Git provider and want to use it as an identity provider for your Daytona installation, you can follow the steps below to configure it. To complete this guide, you will need an active deployment of [BitBucket Server](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/enterprise) and a registered account on your BitBucket Server.

### Configure Bitbucket Server in Keycloak

1. **Log into default realm in Keycloack**

- Log into your Keycloak's Administration with credentials you obtained from the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.
- After you sign in, make sure you are on the **`default realm`**. You should see the homepage show *Welcome to default* at the center of the screen.
- If not (the homepage shows scattered information with *Server info* with the title *master realm*), you can select **`default`** under the dropdown menu on the top left side of the homepage.

2. **Obtain redirect URL**

- Under the default realm, click on **`Identity Providers`** under the *Configure* section on the left sidebar.
- Then click on **`bitbucket-server`** (should be labeled with `disabled` at the moment).
- On the next page, `Provider details`, copy the **`Redirect URI`** and note it down, as we will need it later. *Don't close this tab*.

3. **Create OAuth Application**

- Open your Bitbucket Server dashboard in the browser. On the top right side of the page, click on the settings button (with a gear icon).
- Then click on **`Application Links`** under the *SYSTEM* section on the left sidebar (under *Application Navigator*).
- Click on **`Create link`** on the top right side of the *Application links* page.
- Select **`External application`** under *Application type*.
- Under the *Direction* section, select **Incoming**.
- Click on **`Continue`**.

4. **Configure Application in Bitbucket Server**

- For the **`application name`**, we recommend using your Daytona deploy domain for easy recognition.
- Under *Application details*, paste the *Redirect URI* you have copied from the previous step (from the Keycloak dashboard) into the **`Redirect URL`** field.
- Under *Application permission*, select **Read and Write under Repositories**.
- Then click on **`Save`** at the bottom.

5. **Configure Keycloak**

- Copy and paste the *Client ID* from Bitbucket into the **`Client ID`** field on Keycloak's *Provider details* page.
- Copy and paste the *Client secret* into the **`Client Secret`** field on Keycloak.
- **! important**: At the **`Base URL`** input field in Keycloak, paste your Bitbucket Server URL (the dashboard URL where it is deployed, no trailing slash at the end).

:::caution
You need to input your **`Base URL`** without the last trailing slash. For example, if your Bitbucket Server URL is `https://bitbucket-server.example.com`, you will need to input `https://bitbucket-server.example.com` into the `Base URL` field.<br/>
If you input `https://bitbucket-server.example.com/`, this step will fail.
:::

6. **Configure Scopes in Keycloak**

- Under the *Advance settings* section, copy and paste the following value into the field **`Scope`**:

```shell
    PUBLIC_REPOS REPO_READ REPO_WRITE
```

> If you are unsure about the settings under *Advance settings* in Keycloak, you can refer to the [table below](#bitbucket-server-and-keycloak-configuration-details) to make sure the settings are correct.
> These permission scopes will allow us to access authenticated users' repositories to create a Workspace (without destructive behavior).

7. **Enable Bitbucket Server**

- After finishing the above steps, on Keycloak, click **`Save`** at the bottom, and then enable the identity provider (toggle the *Disabled* switch on the top right side of the page to **`Enabled`**).

### Confirm Google is Working
You can now open your Daytona dashboard on the browser and try to sign in with your Google account.

## Azure Active Directory (now Microsoft Entra ID)
The following section will guide you through how to configure Azure as an identity provider for your Daytona installation. You will need a registered Azure account associated with a registered Microsoft Azure tenant. We assume you are familiar with Azure interface and have experience interacting with it.

### Configure Azure Active Directory in Keycloak

1. **Log into Default Realm in Keycloak**

- Log into your Keycloak's Administration with credentials you obtained from the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.
- After you sign in, make sure you are on the **`default realm`**. You should see the homepage show *Welcome to default* at the center of the screen.
- If not (the homepage shows scattered information with *Server info* with the title *master realm*), you can select **`default`** under the dropdown menu on the top left side of the homepage.

2. **Obtain Redirect URL**

- Under the default realm, click on **`Identity Providers`** under the *Configure* section on the left sidebar.
- Click on **`azure`** (should be labeled with `disabled` at the moment).
- On the next page, *Provider details*, copy the **`Redirect URI`** and note it down, as we will need it later. *Don't close this tab*.

3. **Register an Application in Azure**

- Sign in to your Azure portal with [this link](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/CreateApplicationBlade/isMSAApp~/false). Or on your Azure portal, search for **App registrations** and then click on **`New registration`**.
- For **`Name`**, we recommend using your Daytona deploy domain for easy recognition.
- For **`Supported account types`**, you can choose an option based on your organization needs. If you often have external contractors, select **`Accounts in any organizational directory`**.
- Under the *Redirect URI* section, select **`Web`** and paste the *Redirect URI* you have copied from the previous step (from the Keycloak dashboard) into the **`Redirect URI`** input field.
- Click on **`Register`**.

4. **Copy Client ID and Secrets**

- You will then be redirected to the *overview* page of your application.
- Copy the **`Application (client) ID`** and paste it into your Keycloak *Provider details* page in the *Client ID* section.
- Under *Certificates & secrets*, click on **`New client secret`**. Copy the **`Value`** and paste it into your Keycloak *Provider details* page in the *Client Secret* section.

5. **Configure Keycloak**

- Under *Advance settings*, copy and paste the following value into the field **`Scope`**:

```shell
openid profile email user.read

### Confirm Azure is Working
You can now open your Daytona dashboard on the browser and try to sign in with your Azure/Microsoft account.

## Disable Identity Provider

In this section, we will walk you through how to disable an identity provider on Keycloak for your Daytona installation. 

1. **Sign into Keycloak**

- Go onto `https://id.domain.com` in the browser and click on **`Administration Console`**, then sign in with the credentials you've obtained while installing Daytona.

2. **Select Identity Providers on the Default Realm**

- Once you sign in, confirm on the top left corner of the page that you are on the **`default`** realm. Select **`Identity providers`** under the *Configure* section.

3. **Toggle Disable**

- On the *Identity providers* page, click on the identity provider you wish to disable. You will then be directed to the Identity providers > Provider details > selected-identity-provider page. On the top right side of the configuration page, toggle *Enabled* to **`Disabled`**.

#### Delete Identity Provider on Keycloak 

:::caution 
- Try not to delete your initial identity provider. For example, if you use **`Github`** as your identity provider when you are installing Daytona using the [installer](https://github.com/daytonaio/installer), we won't recommend you to **`delete`** it because of the initial security policy set up in Keycloak. We would strongly advise you to **disable** it rather than delete it.
- This action is irreversible. If you want to add it back later, we won't be able to help you at the moment.
