## What are Workspaces?

A workspace is a self-contained development environment, pre-configured with the projectâ€™s source code, required dependencies, necessary tools, and extensions to optimize workflow for your development team.

Daytona workspaces simplify the setup and configuration of development environments, integrate various tools, automate repetitive tasks, and ensure a consistent experience across different teams and projects. By following established practices and automation, Development Environment Management ensures that all developers have access to a consistent, secure, and standardized environment, ultimately enhancing productivity and streamlining the software development process.

## Managing Workspaces


## Managing secrets
1. Environment variables on dashboard
- Log into your Daytona dashboard in your browser, click on **Environment variables** on the left.
- Click on **Add**.
- Each environment variable requires a **Name** and a **Value**. Input them as the same as a `.env` file.
- Then click on **Add** to save them.

2. Using environment variables in your workspace
- The same as how you'd be using it in your local environment, without the need to create a `.env` file.

### Separating secrets per environment
To separate secrets in production, development and staging environment, you can use products like [**Doppler**](https://www.doppler.com/), [**Hashicorp Vault**](https://www.vaultproject.io/), [**AWS Secrets Manager**](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) and [**Infisical**](https://www.infisical.com/) or similar secret management tools.

We have a detailed guide on how to use Doppler with Daytona [here](https://www.daytona.io/dotfiles/managing-secrets-with-doppler-in-devcontainers). Following this guide, you will be able to use [Doppler's CLI](https://docs.doppler.com/docs/cli) to manage your secrets and environment variables in your workspaces across teams. It applies to secrets used in production environment, development environment and staging environment.

### Accessing Workspace
