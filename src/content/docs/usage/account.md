Each Daytona account can be configured to your needs, enhancing productivity and usability through setting global dotfiles, environment variables, and SSH keys, and an editor for your workspaces.
You can connect your account to additional Git providers for even more flexibility in accessing projects across your organization.

## Default IDE
You can choose a default editor to connect to your workspaces with using the Daytona dashboard.
Daytona supports multiple standalone desktop editors and an in-browser version of Visual Studio Code.

:::tip
For a full list of editors and IDEs supported by Daytona, see *[IDEs](/usage/ides)*.
:::

1. Navigate to the *Settings* page under *Account* in the sidebar.

3. Choose your desired editor in the dropdown menu.

## Adding Dotfiles
You can configure new workspaces to be populated with a set of dotfiles at creation time using the Daytona dashboard.

After setting a Git repository for dotfiles, Daytona will clone the repository into the home directory of each new workspace.
This allows you to share a common set of configuration across your workspaces.
Examples of potential configuration include shell configuration (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`) and CLI tool configuration in `~/.config/`.

:::note
To use this feature, you need the URL of a Git repository with your desired dotfiles.
