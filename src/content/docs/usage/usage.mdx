Daytona provides an overview of your resources usage within your current quota limits. This allows you to better understand where optimizations can be made to keep your usage under your current quota limits.

Metadata in the usage page specifies the current state of resources and quota limits. If the usage does not exist for your team, the page will display *No usage found*.

Usage is determined on a per-team basis, allowing you to view the resources consumed within your team's quota limits.
