Daytona provides an overview of your resources usage within your current quota limits. This allows you to better understand where optimizations can be made to keep your usage under your current quota limits.

Usage is determined on a per-team basis, allowing you to view the resources consumed within your team's quota limits.

- **Used Credits**

  Credits are a measure of resource consumption. Indicates the number of credits you have used compared to your total available credits.

  Example: `500.00/10020`

- **Active Workspaces**

  Specifies how many Workspaces are currently running versus the maximum number you can have active simultaneously.

  Example: `0/3`


View the resources usage within your current quota limits by accessing the **`Usage`** page in the dashboard sidebar. Additionally, you can view the history of your Workspace usage sessions.
