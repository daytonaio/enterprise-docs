Each Daytona account can be configured to your needs, enhancing productivity and usability through setting global dotfiles, environment variables, and SSH keys, and an editor for your workspaces.
You can connect your account to additional Git providers for even more flexibility in accessing projects across your organization.

    The license tier your Daytona account is associated with.

- **Version**

    The version of Daytona you are using.


## Adding Dotfiles

You can configure new workspaces to be populated with a set of dotfiles at creation time using the Daytona dashboard.

After setting a Git repository for dotfiles, Daytona will clone the repository into the home directory of each new workspace.
This allows you to share a common set of configuration across your workspaces.
Examples of potential configuration include shell configuration (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`) and CLI tool configuration in `~/.config/`.

:::note
To use this feature, you need the URL of a Git repository with your desired dotfiles.

1. Navigate to the *Settings* page under *Account* in the sidebar.
2. Under *Dotfiles*, specify the URL of the Git repository containing your dotfiles.
3. Click the **`Update`** button to save the configuration.
