Git Providers — sometimes known as software forges or Source Code Managers (SCMs) — provide a set of tools to host and collaborate on codebases using Git.

Daytona allows you to integrate your preferred Git Provider, enhancing your development workflow. This integration enables you to access and manage your repositories directly within Daytona, simplifying Workspace creation from existing projects.

By adding a Git Provider, your credentials are securely embedded into your Workspaces. This allows for seamless Git operations without repeated authentication.

## Add a Git Provider

You can integrate Daytona with a Git Provider to manage version control operations and interact with your Git repositories.

Daytona supports a variety of Git Providers, including [GitHub](/#github), [GitLab](#gitlab), [Bitbucket](#bitbucket), and [Bitbucket Server](#bitbucket-server).

This integration supports and enables interacting with your codebase, cloning repositories, and pushing changes directly from Daytona.

1. Navigate to your profile account and select **`Settings`**.
2. In the Identity Providers section, select **`Connect`** next to the Git Provider you want to integrate.
3. Click **`Authorize`** when prompted to authorize Daytona OAuth application.

## Remove a Git provider

Daytona allows you to remove Git Providers, helping you manage and delete those that are no longer required.

1. Navigate to your profile account and select **`Settings`**.
