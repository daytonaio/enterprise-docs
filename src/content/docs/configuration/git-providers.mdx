## Github

#### First-time sign-in
1. When you are signing in via GitHub for the first time, you will be redirected to Github's application authorization page and then asked to `Authorize <your-oauth-app-name>`. You will need to click `Authorize <username>`. On the authorization page, you can also grant access(organizations you own) or request access(organization owned by others) by clicking on respective `Grant` and `Request`. If you don't want to add extra authorization other than yourself for now you can always add them back later.
2. Then you will be redirected to a Daytona dashboard registration page to complete your profile setup, where you will need a username, email, first name, and last name. Once you confirm the submission, you will be able to sign in to your Daytona dashboard using Github as an identity provider and create workspaces using repositories in Github.

#### Full confirmation
To confirm Github is working properly with Daytona, open your Daytona dashboard URL and check if you can see the button `Github` on the sign-in page, sign in via Github and on the `Workspaces` page (select on the left sidebar), click on `Create`. Select a workspace and click on `Create` to see if you can create a workspace based on the repository in Github.


### Organisation access

In this section, we will explain how you can add and configure Github's organization access for your Daytona installation.

#### First-time sign-in
When you are signing in for the first time, you can `Grant` or `Request` for the organization you are in to give your Daytona installation access to repositories within the organization. If you select none but click `Authorize <username>` directly, you will only be able to access your own repositories(both public and private) and other public repositories(owned by organizations or individuals) initially unless further access is granted.

#### Request organization access

1. On the upper-right corner of any page, click on your profile and scroll down on the dropdown menu, select `Settings`.
2. In the `Integration` section of the sidebar, click `Application`.
3. On the top of the page, click the `Authorized OAuth Apps` tab.
4. In the list of applications, click the name of the OAuth app you have set up Daytona access for.
5. Next to the organization you'd like the OAuth app to access, click `Request access`.
6. After you review the information about requesting OAuth app access, click `Request approval from owners`. If you are an admin in this organization, you can approve it by yourself, otherwise, you'll need to contact your admin to approve the authorization request.


## Gitlab

#### First-time sign-in
1. On the first time sign in, you will be redirected to a User Settings page on Gitlab, with a banner indicating `The application was created successfully`. Here you will be asked to `Authorize  <application-name> to use your account?` with the information of who created this application, as well as the authorized scope. Once you confirm the access scopes are correct, you can click on `Authorize` at the bottom of the page.

2. After confirming access scope, you will be redirected to a Daytona dashboard registration page to complete your profile setup, where you will need a username, email, first name, and last name. Once you confirm the submission, you will be able to sign in to your Daytona dashboard using Gitlab as an identity provider and create workspaces using repositories in Gitlab.

#### Full confirmation
To confirm the identity provider is working properly, open your Daytona dashboard URL and check if you can see the button `Gitlab` on the sign-in page, sign in via Gitlab and on the `Workspaces` page (select on the left sidebar), click on `Create`. Select a workspace and click on `Create` to see if you can create a workspace based on the repository in GitLab.


### Organisation access
No further configuration is required.

On Gitlab, organizations are referred to as `Groups` (where users can manage members with shared repositories). No extra configuration is needed to access `Groups` on Gitlab when you are using Daytona. Once you are signed in to your Daytona dashboard via Gitlab account, you can access all the `Groups`.


## BitBucket

#### First-time sign-in
Open your Daytona dashboard URL, there will be an option to sign in via BitBucket. The first time signing in, you will be redirected to BitBucket's OAuth authorization page to confirm your access rights (the page with the title `Confirm access to your account` and with the OAuth consumer application name you just created below). On this page, to confirm using BitBucket as your identity provider, click on `Grant access`.

Once you click on `Grant access`, you will be redirected to your Daytona dashboard's `Workspaces` page (You can confirm configurations are set up correctly now).

:::note
If your BitBucket account has the same email as other identity providers, you will be asked `User with email <your-email> already exists. How do you want to continue?`. Click on `Add to existing account` to continue. On the next page, select the account (with identity provider) you want to link it to (Github or Gitlab).

#### Full confirmation

To confirm BitBucket is working properly with Daytona, open your Daytona dashboard URL and check if you can see the button `BitBucket` on the sign-in page, sign in via BitBucket and on the `Workspaces` page (select on the left sidebar), click on `Create`. Select a workspace and click on their right side, `Create`, to see if you can create a workspace based on the repository in BitBucket and then work on it in Theia or [other IDEs](/usage/ides)

### Organisation access
No further configuration is required.

In BitBucket, organizations are referred to as a `Workspace`, and workspace members are managed under `Access management` (in workspace settings page). When you sign in to a BitBucket account and start to work on a repository by default you will be working in a `Workspace` (in BitBucket). Once you added BitBucket as an identity provider and configured it as above, your Daytona installation will be able to access all your workspaces.


## BitBucket Server

#### First-time sign-in
Open your Daytona dashboard URL, there should be an option to sign in via BitBucket Server. When you sign in for the first time, you will be redirected to BitBucket Server's OAuth authorization page to confirm your access rights (the page with the title `<your-app-name> would like to access your Bitbucket account`). After confirming all the access rights, click on `Allow`.

After you click on `Allow`, you will be redirected to your Daytona dashboard's `Workspaces` page (You can confirm configurations are set up correctly now). If you click on `Settings` on the left sidebar, you will see your BitBucket Server and your account is under the `Git Providers` section.
