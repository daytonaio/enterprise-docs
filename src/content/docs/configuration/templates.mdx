Templates are displayed on the right side of your Daytona dashboard when you try to create a [workspace](/usage/workspaces). You can use them to customize your Daytona dashboard in combination with [devcontainer](https://www.daytona.io/dotfiles/advanced-configuration-techniques-for-dev-container) during deployment to create workspaces faster based on your requirements.

We will walk through our default templates, the content of each template, how to customise your own templates and how to deploy them a custom template to your Daytona dashboard.

We assume you have a successful Daytona deployment and gained access to a Daytona dashboard URL.

## Default templates index

The default template index is a JSON file that contains an array of 13 objects. Each object represents a template. The template is located in [this repository](https://github.com/daytonaio/samples-index/blob/main/index.json).

{/* <!-- TODO: try template created in one repo and see if the problem with setting remote origin URL persists.  --> */}


If you accidentally removed all the default templates and want to add it back, you might want to take the default templates.

## Construct of a template 

A simpliest example of a template includes below properties. Each of the properties is **case sensitive**. This section will help you **create your own template**.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "C# (.NET)",
    "description": "Develop C# and .NET based applications. Includes all needed SDKs, extensions, and dependencies.",
    "gitUrl": "https://github.com/daytonaio-templates/dotnet",
    "imageUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daytonaio-templates/index/main/img/dotnet.png",
    "rawReadmeUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daytonaio-templates/dotnet/main/README.md"
  }
]
```
{/* <!-- TODO: try template created in one repo and see if the problem with setting remote origin URL persists.  --> */}

<dl>
<dt>name</dt>
<dd>
- Required. 
- Name of the template being displayed on the Daytona dashboard.
</dd>
<dt>description</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>imageUrl</dt>
<dd>

## Customizing templates

If you wish to customize your own template, you can create a copy of our [default template](https://github.com/daytonaio/samples-index/blob/main/index.json) and edit it to suit your needs.

#### Requirement of a custom template

- **Hosted publicly**, be it git provider or elsewhere.
- An **array** of objects that is accessible as **raw content**.
- Each object needs to include the required properties (as seen [here](#construct-of-a-template)).
- **gitUrl** field needs to be a **public repository**. This will be the core content of your template and how your workspace will be built.

#### Obtaining raw content from a public repository

You can obtain raw content easily if the images and content of templates are available publicly with your Git provider.

We will be using README.me file as an example. You can do the same for other content.

1. Obtain raw content link from GitHub

- Open a public repository on GitHub in browser. In your repository's list of files, select the **README.md** file.

- In the upper right corner of the file view, click **Raw** to see the raw content.

- **Copy the URL** in the browser. This link is a raw content link suitable for the value of _rawReadmeUrl_ field.

2. Obtain raw content link from Gitlab

- Open a public repository on GitLab in the browser. In your repository's list of files, select the **README.md** file.

- In the upper right corner of the file view, click on **Open Raw** to see the raw content (hover to see **Open Raw**, the button is in between the _Download_ button and _Copy file content_ button).

- **Copy the URL** in the browser. This link is a raw content link suitable for the value of _rawReadmeUrl_ field.

3. Obtain raw content link from BitBucket

- Open a public repository on BitBucket in the browser. In your repository's list of files, select the **README.md** file.
- In the upper right corner of the file view, click on the **`ð“ˆ“`** button next to _Edit_ and select **Open raw**.

- **Copy the URL** in the browser. This link is a raw content link suitable for the value of the _rawReadmeUrl_ field.

:::danger
If your custom template is not an array object it might fail to deploy. You can use [this template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daytonaio-templates/index/main/templates.json) as a reference.

## Deploy custom templates

You can build your own template within your organization to suit your development needs. While the [Daytona installer script](https://github.com/daytonaio/installer) lives in your virtual machine, you can edit the file content to customize your template.

{/*TODO: need to test this: host a json file within the machine and not making it public. */}

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Edit in installer script">

1. Copy the raw content of your template
- Following the step [obtaining raw content from a public repository](#obtaining-raw-content-from-a-public-repository) to obtain the raw content of your template index after you customize it. 
- **Copy the link** and note it down.

2. Open the shell of your virtual machine

- You can **SSH** into your virtual machine within your terminal.
- You can also open the shell of your virtual machine within the browser if your cloud provider supports so.

3. Edit variable **TEMPLATE_INDEX_URL** in installer script

- Entering the installer folder and edit it via nano. You can use any text editor you prefer.

```bash
cd installer
nano setup.sh
```

- On the top of the file, find the variable **`TEMPLATE_INDEX_URL`** (on line 17) and replace the value with your raw content link from step 1.

- After finishing editing, press <Keyboard shortcuts={['Ctrl', 'O']}/> to save and press <Keyboard shortcuts={['Enter']}/> to confirm. 

- Press <Keyboard shortcuts={[`Ctrl`, `X`]}/> to exit nano.


4. Redeploy the script 

- Run the script again to deploy your custom template. Optionally you can pass in any arguments you need.

```bash
./setup.sh
```

- You can see more about the **arguments** you can pass in [here](https://github.com/daytonaio/installer#setup) to help you with identity provider and domain set up. 

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Using custom update script">

1. Copy the raw content of your template
- Following the step [obtaining raw content from a public repository](#obtaining-raw-content-from-a-public-repository) to obtain the raw content of your template index after you customize it. 
- **Copy the link** and note it down.

2. Open the shell of your virtual machine

- You can **SSH** into your virtual machine within your terminal.
- You can also open the shell of your virtual machine within the browser if your cloud provider supports so.

3. Creating new script 
- Within the installer directory, create a new file with the name **`update-template.sh`**.

```bash
nano update-template.sh
```
- Copy the content below into the file.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# https://blog.mdminhazulhaque.io/extract-patch-file-configmap

URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daytonaio/samples-index/main/index.json"

# parse the arguments for --url
while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
  key="$1"
  case $key in
    -u|--url)
      URL="$2"
      shift
      shift
      ;;
    *)
      shift
      ;;
  esac
done

# error if no url is provided
if [[ -z "$URL" ]]; then
  echo "ERROR: no url provided"
  exit 1
fi

kubectl -n watkins get configmap watkins-dashboard -o go-template='{{index .data "configuration.json"}}' | \
    jq --arg url "$URL" '.workspaceTemplatesIndexUrl = $url' > configuration.json

# trap the exit signal to delete configuration.json when the script exits
trap 'rm -f configuration.json' EXIT

echo "Replacing: $(kubectl -n watkins get configmap watkins-dashboard -o go-template='{{index .data "configuration.json"}}' | jq -r .workspaceTemplatesIndexUrl)"
echo "With: $URL"

kubectl -n watkins create configmap watkins-dashboard --from-file=configuration.json=configuration.json --dry-run=client -o yaml | \
    kubectl -n watkins patch configmaps watkins-dashboard --type merge --patch-file /dev/stdin

# restart the watkins-dashboard pod
kubectl -n watkins rollout restart deployment watkins-dashboard
kubectl -n watkins rollout status deployment watkins-dashboard --watch
```
- Press <Keyboard shortcuts={['Ctrl', 'O']}/> to save and press <Keyboard shortcuts={['Enter']}/> to confirm. Use <Keyboard shortcuts={[`Ctrl`, `X`]}/> to exit nano.

4. Running the script
- Stay in the installer directory and run the script with the raw content link of your template. You will need your raw content link from step 1.

```bash
./update-template.sh -u <your raw content link>
```
- When the script finished running, you should be able to see the changes on your Daytona dashboard.

:::tip
You can make the script executable by running `chmod +x update-template.sh` in the installer directory.
