Templates are displayed on the right side of your Daytona dashboard when you try to create a [workspace](/usage/workspaces). You can use them to customize your Daytona dashboard in combination with [devcontainer](https://www.daytona.io/dotfiles/advanced-configuration-techniques-for-dev-container) during deployment to create workspaces faster based on your requirements.

We will walk through our default templates, the content of each template, how to customise your own templates and how to deploy them a custom template to your Daytona dashboard.

We assume you have a successful Daytona deployment and gained access to a Daytona dashboard URL.

## Default templates index

The default template index is a JSON file that contains an array of 13 objects. Each object represents a template. The template is located in [this repository](https://github.com/daytonaio/samples-index/blob/main/index.json).

## Construct of a template 


<hr/>

## Customizing templates

Templates are **an array of JSON objects** that include certain properties. They construct the textual and visual appearance of the templates on your dashboards.

### Content of a template

The simplest example of a template includes below properties:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "C# (.NET)",
    "description": "Develop C# and .NET based applications. Includes all needed SDKs, extensions, and dependencies.",
    "gitUrl": "https://github.com/daytonaio-templates/dotnet",
    "imageUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daytonaio-templates/index/main/img/dotnet.png",
    "rawReadmeUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daytonaio-templates/dotnet/main/README.md"
  }
]
```

Your template will need to be:

- **Hosted publicly**, be it git provider or elsewhere.
- An **array** of objects is accessible as **raw content**.
- Each object needs to include the below properties and each properties are **case sensitive**:

<dl>
<dt>name</dt>
<dd>Name of the template being displayed on the Daytona dashboard</dd>
<dt>description</dt>
<dd>The description of the template. This property won't be displayed it'd be helpful to take notes when you are creating them.</dd>
{/* <!-- TODO: try template created in one repo and see if the problem with setting remote origin URL persists.  --> */}
<dt>gitUrl</dt>
<dd>The content of this template.</dd>
<dt>imageUrl</dt>
<dd>An image display on the template when it is deployed to the dashboard. It supports JPG, JPEG, SVG and PNG formats. It can be a link to any public image.</dd>
<dt>rawReadmeUrl</dt>
<dd>Textual content is displayed on the pop-up dialog after you click on the selected template button on the dashboard. Helping users understand the content of the template. It has to be the raw content of a markdown file. </dd>
</dl>

### Obtaining raw content from a public repository

You can obtain raw content easily if the images and content of templates are available publicly with your Git provider.

We will be using README.me file as an example. You can do the same for other content.

1. Obtain raw content link from GitHub

- Open a public repository on GitHub in browser. In your repository's list of files, select the **README.md** file.

- In the upper right corner of the file view, click **Raw** to see the raw content.

- **Copy the URL** in the browser. This link is a raw content link suitable for the value of _rawReadmeUrl_ field.

2. Obtain raw content link from Gitlab

- Open a public repository on GitLab in the browser. In your repository's list of files, select the **README.md** file.

- In the upper right corner of the file view, click on **Open Raw** to see the raw content (hover to see **Open Raw**, the button is in between the _Download_ button and _Copy file content_ button).

- **Copy the URL** in the browser. This link is a raw content link suitable for the value of _rawReadmeUrl_ field.

3. Obtain raw content link from BitBucket

- Open a public repository on BitBucket in the browser. In your repository's list of files, select the **README.md** file.
- In the upper right corner of the file view, click on the **`𓈓`** button next to _Edit_ and select **Open raw**.

- **Copy the URL** in the browser. This link is a raw content link suitable for the value of the _rawReadmeUrl_ field.

:::danger
If your custom template is not an array object it might fail to deploy. You can use [this template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daytonaio-templates/index/main/templates.json) as a reference.
:::

<hr/>

## Deploy custom templates

You can build your own template within your organization to suit your development needs.

### Deploy with Daytona installer

After you clone the [Daytona installer](http://github.com/daytonaio/installer) to your virtual machine, you can edit the shell script content to customize your template.

{/*TODO: need to test this: host a json file within the machine and not making it public. */}
1. Copy the raw content of your template
- Following the step [obtaining raw content from a public repository](#obtaining-raw-content-from-a-public-repository) to obtain the raw content of your template after you customised it. 
- **Copy the link** and note it down.

2. Open the shell of your virtual machine

- You can **SSH** into your virtual machine within your terminal.
- You can also open the shell of your virtual machine within the browser if your cloud provider supports so.

3. Edit variable **TEMPLATE_INDEX_URL** in installer script

- Entering the installer folder and edit it via nano. You can use any text editor you prefer.

```bash
cd installer
nano setup.sh
```

- On the top of the file, find the variable **`TEMPLATE_INDEX_URL`** (on line 17) and replace the value with your raw content link from step 1.

- After finishing editing, press <Keyboard shortcuts={['Ctrl', 'O']}/> to save and press <Keyboard shortcuts={['Enter']}/> to confirm. 

- Press <Keyboard shortcuts={[`Ctrl`, `X`]}/> to exit nano.


4. Redeploy the script 

- Run the script again to deploy your custom template. Optionally you can pass in any arguments you need.

```bash
./setup.sh
```

- You can see more about the **arguments** you can pass in [here](https://github.com/daytonaio/installer#setup) to help you with identity provider and domain set up. 

:::note
It will take a few minutes to redeploy your template. After the deployment, you might need to do a hard refresh on your browser (using <Keyboard shortcuts={['Ctrl', 'Shift', 'R']}/>) to see the changes.

### Deploy with Terraform

If you are deploying Daytona on Google Cloud Platform with terraform, you can customise the template in terraform. We assume you are **familiar with terraform**, and **Google cloud CLI**, with Google cloud credentials set up on your local machine.

Below is an example to customise your template [using terraform on Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/daytonaio/gcp-example).

1. Copy the raw content of your template
- Following the step [obtaining raw content from a public repository](#obtaining-raw-content-from-a-public-repository) to obtain the raw content of your template after you customised it.
- **Copy the link** and note it down.

2. Open the terraform file

- Optional: clone the Daytona GCP example to your **local machine** by running the command below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daytonaio/gcp-example.git
```
- Open the folder in your preferred text editor and find the file `daytona.tf` in `tf-2-k8s` folder.

3. Replace the default template value

- Find the value of the variable **`workspaceTemplatesIndexUrl`** (on line 43) and **replace the value with your raw content link from step 1**.

- Save the file. **Enter the folder `tf-2-k8s` in your terminal** and run below command to validate the file.

```bash
terraform validate
```
- Optionally you can run below command to **generate a plan** and see if any breaking changes have happened. Assuming you have already set up your terraform environment and ran `terraform init` in the folder.

```bash
terraform plan
```
- After passing the validation, you can run below command to **apply** the changes.

```bash
terraform apply
```


You can read more about [terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cli) and learn about [using terraform with Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform).
