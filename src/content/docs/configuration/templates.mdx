Templates are displayed on the right side of your Daytona dashboard when you try to create a [workspace](/usage/workspaces). You can use them to customize your Daytona dashboard in combination with [devcontainer](https://www.daytona.io/dotfiles/advanced-configuration-techniques-for-dev-container) during deployment to create workspaces faster based on your requirements.

We will walk through how to customize them, create workspaces and repositories based on templates, to deploy your own templates and the default templates on the Daytona dashboard.

<hr/>

## Prerequisites

1. Daytona dashboard URL

After successfully deploying Daytona, you will be provided with a dashboard URL. You will need it to access your dashboard in the browser or create local profiles (as a record of your deployment).

2. Optional: Daytona CLI

You can use Daytona CLI to create workspaces and repositories based on templates. If you haven't installed it yet, you can run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
brew install daytonaio/daytona/daytona
```
Read more about [Daytona CLI and how to use it](/tools/cli).

<hr/>

## Creating workspaces from templates

By creating a workspace, we assume that you either have a successful Daytona deployment and gained access to a Daytona dashboard URL, or you have Daytona CLI installed on your local machine.



<Tabs>
<TabItem label="From dashboard">
1. Open the Workspaces tab on Daytona dashboard

- Sign in to your Daytona dashboard in the browser, select **Workspaces**.
- Click on **Create**, on the right side we have provided a set of default templates.

2. Creating a workspace based on a template

- Choose one of the templates and click on it, then click **Create** on the opened dialog.
- A new browser tab will open indicating workspace is setting up. 
- Upon successful creation you can choose to open the workspace in [**default editor**](/usage/ides) (available to set up in [account settings](/usage/account#default-editor)) or **browser**, connect to the workspace via **SSH**, or go back to the dashboard.
- Open it in your default editor to continue.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="From CLI">
We will refer to the URL as `https://git.com/user/repo` in the following steps.

:::note
You will need a public repository's URL as a template to create a workspace based on templates. 

If you don't have one, you can create one on your Git provider. Or use one of our [default templates](#default-templates) as a reference.
:::

1. Check if you have existing profiles

In your terminal, run the command below to check if you have existing profiles and select one to use.

```bash
daytona profile
```
If you don't have one, you can create one by running the command below and follow the instructions.

```bash
daytona profile new
```
The CLI will guide you to input name of profile and dashboard URL to create a profile. 

2. Create a workspace

- In your terminal, run the command below to create a workspace based on a template.

```bash
daytona create https://git.com/user/repo
```
> - If you are not authenticated yet, you will be prompted to open an authentication link to authenticate with your Daytona dashboard. 
> - After successful authentication, you need to run the same command again to create a workspace.

- After inputting the command, the terminal will display the status of workspace creation. When it is finished, you can run the below commands in terminal to start developing: 
  
```bash
daytona code
```
- The terminal will list your current workspace. Use the arrow keys to select one and press <Keyboard shortcuts={['Enter']}/> to open it in your default editor. 
- The default editor is VS Code in browser. You can set up other default editors in your Daytona dashboard by following [this guide](/usage/account).

:::note 
If you don't passed in a URL, the Daytona CLI will go through the existing repository in your default Git config to help you create a workspace. 

You can use the arrow keys to select one.
:::
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<hr/>

##### Optional: Connecting your workspace to a new Git repository

To facilitate CI/CD, you might need to reset repository URL upon template creation.

- Create a new repository in your git provider and **copy the repository URL** (we will refer to it as `https://github.com/user/repo.git`)
- When your default editor is opened, open the terminal in your editor (you will be in a terminal session connected to workspace) and run this command to set up a new remote url.

```bash
git remote add origin `https://github.com/user/repo.git`
```

- To confirm it is set up correctly, run the below command and check the value of **remote.origin.url**.

```bash
git config --list
```

<details class="idp-details">
<summary>Example: Connect to GitHub using GitHub CLI</summary>
<content>
Although our templates include Git, you will still need to authenticate with your Git provider to push and pull to your remote repository. We are using GitHub as an example below.

1. Install GitHub CLI

- While you are connected to a running workspace, in your editor's terminal, run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
```

- These commands install the GitHub CLI, you can see the official reference [here](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md#official-sources)

2. Authenticate using GitHub CLI

- Then in your terminal, run the command below and select the provided options based on your requirements.

```bash
gh auth login
```

- When you are asked for _preferred protocol for Git operation_, choose **SSH**.

- This command will either generate a new SSH key to upload to your GitHub account or upload your current public key based on your selection.

- After finishing the authentication process, you should be able to push and pull to your repository.

- Your authenticating status will persist within this workspace.

{/*_ <!-- TODO: consider deleting this and let user handle the conflicts themselves --> _*/}

<details class="idp-details">
<summary>Resolve merge conflicts</summary>
<content>
In a scenario you created the repository on GitHub with a license file, README.md and other initial configurations.

Your push/pull might fail and you are prompted to resolve merge conflicts. You can run this command to allow unrelated histories from the remote to be merged with local files.

```bash
git merge --allow-unrelated-histories origin/main

```

## Customizing templates

Templates are **an array of JSON objects** that include certain properties. They construct the textual and visual appearance of the templates on your dashboards.

### Content of a template

The simplest example of a template includes below properties:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "C# (.NET)",
    "description": "Develop C# and .NET based applications. Includes all needed SDKs, extensions, and dependencies.",
    "gitUrl": "https://github.com/daytonaio-templates/dotnet",
    "imageUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daytonaio-templates/index/main/img/dotnet.png",
    "rawReadmeUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daytonaio-templates/dotnet/main/README.md"
  }
]
```

Your template will need to be:

- **Hosted publicly**, be it git provider or elsewhere.
- An **array** of objects is accessible as **raw content**.
- Each object needs to include the below properties and each properties are **case sensitive**:

<dl>
<dt>name</dt>
<dd>Name of the template being displayed on the Daytona dashboard</dd>
<dt>description</dt>
<dd>The description of the template. This property won't be displayed it'd be helpful to take notes when you are creating them.</dd>
{/* <!-- TODO: try template created in one repo and see if the problem with setting remote origin URL persists.  --> */}
<dt>gitUrl</dt>
<dd>The content of this template.</dd>
<dt>imageUrl</dt>
<dd>An image display on the template when it is deployed to the dashboard. It supports JPG, JPEG, SVG and PNG formats. It can be a link to any public image.</dd>
<dt>rawReadmeUrl</dt>
<dd>Textual content is displayed on the pop-up dialog after you click on the selected template button on the dashboard. Helping users understand the content of the template. It has to be the raw content of a markdown file. </dd>
</dl>

### Obtaining raw content from a public repository

You can obtain raw content easily if the images and content of templates are available publicly with your Git provider.

We will be using README.me file as an example. You can do the same for other content.

1. Obtain raw content link from GitHub

- Open a public repository on GitHub in browser. In your repository's list of files, select the **README.md** file.

- In the upper right corner of the file view, click **Raw** to see the raw content.

- **Copy the URL** in the browser. This link is a raw content link suitable for the value of _rawReadmeUrl_ field.

2. Obtain raw content link from Gitlab

- Open a public repository on GitLab in the browser. In your repository's list of files, select the **README.md** file.

- In the upper right corner of the file view, click on **Open Raw** to see the raw content (hover to see **Open Raw**, the button is in between the _Download_ button and _Copy file content_ button).

- **Copy the URL** in the browser. This link is a raw content link suitable for the value of _rawReadmeUrl_ field.

3. Obtain raw content link from BitBucket

- Open a public repository on BitBucket in the browser. In your repository's list of files, select the **README.md** file.
- In the upper right corner of the file view, click on the **`𓈓`** button next to _Edit_ and select **Open raw**.

- **Copy the URL** in the browser. This link is a raw content link suitable for the value of the _rawReadmeUrl_ field.

:::danger
If your custom template is not an array object it might fail to deploy. You can use [this template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daytonaio-templates/index/main/templates.json) as a reference.
:::

<hr/>

## Deploy custom templates

You can build your own template within your organization to suit your development needs.

### Deploy with Daytona installer

After you clone the [Daytona installer](http://github.com/daytonaio/installer) to your virtual machine, you can edit the shell script content to customize your template.

{/*TODO: need to test this: host a json file within the machine and not making it public. */}
1. Copy the raw content of your template
- Following the step [obtaining raw content from a public repository](#obtaining-raw-content-from-a-public-repository) to obtain the raw content of your template after you customised it. 
- **Copy the link** and note it down.

2. Open the shell of your virtual machine

- You can **SSH** into your virtual machine within your terminal.
- You can also open the shell of your virtual machine within the browser if your cloud provider supports so.

3. Edit variable **TEMPLATE_INDEX_URL** in installer script

- Entering the installer folder and edit it via nano. You can use any text editor you prefer.

```bash
cd installer
nano setup.sh
```

- On the top of the file, find the variable **`TEMPLATE_INDEX_URL`** (on line 17) and replace the value with your raw content link from step 1.

- After finishing editing, press <Keyboard shortcuts={['Ctrl', 'O']}/> to save and press <Keyboard shortcuts={['Enter']}/> to confirm. 

- Press <Keyboard shortcuts={[`Ctrl`, `X`]}/> to exit nano.


4. Redeploy the script 

- Run the script again to deploy your custom template. Optionally you can pass in any arguments you need.

```bash
./setup.sh
```

- You can see more about the **arguments** you can pass in [here](https://github.com/daytonaio/installer#setup) to help you with identity provider and domain set up. 

:::note
It will take a few minutes to redeploy your template. After the deployment, you might need to do a hard refresh on your browser (using <Keyboard shortcuts={['Ctrl', 'Shift', 'R']}/>) to see the changes.
:::



### Deploy with Terraform

If you are deploying Daytona on Google Cloud Platform with terraform, you can customise the template in terraform. We assume you are **familiar with terraform**, have terraform installed on your local machine and having terraform required environment set up. 

Below is an example to customise your template using terraform on [Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/daytonaio/gcp-example).

1. Copy the raw content of your template
- Following the step [obtaining raw content from a public repository](#obtaining-raw-content-from-a-public-repository) to obtain the raw content of your template after you customised it.
- **Copy the link** and note it down.

2. Open the terraform file

- Optional: clone the Daytona GCP example to your **local machine** by running the command below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daytonaio/gcp-example.git
```
- Open the folder in your preferred text editor and find the file `daytona.tf` in `tf-2-k8s` folder.

3. Replace the default template value

- Find the value of the variable **`workspaceTemplatesIndexUrl`** (on line 43) and **replace the value with your raw content link from step 1**.

- Save the file. **Enter the folder `tf-2-k8s` in your terminal** and run below command to validate the file.

```bash
terraform validate
```
- Optionally you can run below command to **generate a plan** and see if any breaking changes have happened. Assuming you have already set up your terraform environment and ran `terraform init` in the folder.

```bash
terraform plan
```
- After passing the validation, you can run below command to **apply** the changes.

```bash
terraform apply
```
